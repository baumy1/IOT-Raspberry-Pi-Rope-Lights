# IOT-Raspberry-Pi-Rope-Lights

When deployed on a Raspberry Pi, this will run a bog-standard node web-server, which displays a *very* simple interface that allows anyone with access to change the state of a GPIO pin, which can be used to turn off simple LEDs connected to the pi.

I recomend using using something between the GPIO and the load of the lights for example a motor controller or relay.

We are not responsible for the ultimate safety of your pi. Thank-you.
